      "C. phosphocreatine\n",

      "Explanation: The sole fuel for muscle contraction is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During near maximal intense exercise the muscle store of ATP will be depleted in less than one second. Therefore, to maintain normal contractile function ATP must be continually resynthesized. These pathways include phosphocreatine and muscle glycogen breakdown, thus enabling substrate-level phosphorylation (‘anaerobic’) and oxidative phosphorylation by using reducing equivalents from carbohydrate and fat metabolism (‘aerobic’).\n",
